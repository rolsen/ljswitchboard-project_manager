      <h4><a href="#">Register Matrix Improvements</a></h4>
      <p>The register matrix is an important module because it pretty much exposes all of the device's features.  It is now easier to search for registers, add/remove them, and edit them.  When editing registers that report an IP address the 32bit integer gets automatically converted into an IP address string!  More importantly, you can navigate away from the register matrix and when you come back your selected registers will still be there.</p>

      <h4><a href="#">Lua Scripting</a></h4>
      <p>Developing lua scripts for the T7/T7-Pro is much easier than before.  There updated examples, the editor & console stay "fit" to your screen size, and thanks to the error-handling improvements as well as T7 firmware improvements lua script errors that once plagued kipling are no longer there.</p>

<h4>New Kipling Project Repository</h4>
<p>One of the biggest changes to the project has been the code-base itself.  We re-designed it from being a huge monolythic project and split it up into multiple smaller repositories and have published multiple parts of it to <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a>.  We also transitioned to a two-process architecture due to some issues that we were running into with the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ffi">node-ffi</a> library and <a href="http://nwjs.io/">node-webkit/nwjs</a>.  The project is now MUCH easier to make contributions to and develop for if the community is interested in helping out with the project.  The project has been re-based to the <a href="https://github.com/rolsen/ljswitchboard-project_manager">ljswitchboard-project_manager</a> repository. All of the building and developing tools are available through that repository.</p>
<p>If anyone wants to develop a module for Kipling or has interest in learning more please let us know.  We are happy to make adding documentation for the program's internals a todo if there is interest and have made a github issue for <a href="https://github.com/rolsen/ljswitchboard-project_manager/issues/3">adding documentation</a>where you can express your interest.</p>

<h4>Installing Kiplingv3.1</h4>
<p>For our windows users we released a new version of our <a href="http://labjack.com/support/software">main installer</a> that now includes Kipling.  For our Mac OS X and Linux users the files are currently available through github and the <a href="https://github.com/rolsen/ljswitchboard-project_manager/releases/tag/3.1.0">Kipling Version 3.1.0</a> release tag.  We are in the process of bundling Kipling into our Mac OS X and Linux installers and will likely be able to post those when we go live with our new website.</p>

<h4>Things that broke</h4>
<p>First of all, we are sorry for any inconveniences that these bugs cause you and we are trying to get them fixed.  
<ul>
<li>There is currently a bug for our windows XP users in that Kipling won't start.  If you have this issue, we have some files that we can give you to fix the problem and allow Kipling to start/run.</li>
<li>Because of our new website being released, some of our development/releasing goals changing, and the huge change in the Kipling build process, Kipling's previous version number management scheme broke.  Users have to periodically check our website or e-mail us with questions to know about updates to Kipling.</li>
<li>There are definitely more bugs, but those are the two primary ones.  E-mail us at support@labjack.com if you run into issues or post to the github repository issue tracker and we will try to address them.</li>
</ul>
